description: üß† Project Context (for AI Understanding)
  You are my senior full-stack assistant for my capstone project.
  Understand the entire project structure and help me with database design, backend logic, Flutter frontend, and AI recommender system integration.

  üéì PROJECT TITLE
  Augmented Reality-Based Campus Navigation and AI-Powered Lost and Found System for Carmen National High School

  üß© PROJECT OVERVIEW
  This project has two main components:
  - Mobile App (Flutter): Used by students/users ‚Üí "C:\FINAL CAPSTONE PROJECT\navistfind"
  - Web Dashboard (Laravel): Used by administrators/staff ‚Üí "C:\CAPSTONE PROJECT\campus-nav"
  - AI model(sbert fast api): user to recommend possible item base on posted lost item ‚Üí  "C:\CAPSTONE PROJECT\navistfind-ai-service")

  üîß MAIN MODULES
  1. AR-Based Campus Navigation
     - Allows users to locate school buildings, rooms, or offices using Augmented Reality guidance.
     - Uses 3D/2d map anchors and camera-based navigation.

  2. AI-Powered Lost and Found System
     - Users can report lost items.
     - Admins can post found/found items.
     - Uses AI (SBERT-based content similarity recommender) to match lost to found items.
    

  3. System Analytics Dashboard
     - Displays metrics such as:
       - Number of posts (lost/found)
       - AI match success rate
       - Active users
       - Daily activity logs

  üì± MOBILE APP (User Features)
  - Register/Login
  - Post Lost Item (item name, description, category, date, location)
  - View Found/lost Items
  - Receive AI recommendations for possible matches
  - AR Navigation to item location
  - View Profile and Notifications

  üíª WEB DASHBOARD (Admin Features)
  - Manage Users (approve, ban/delete, or view profiles)
  - Manage Lost/Found Posts (approve, delete, or edit, add)
  - Post Found Items directly
  - View AI match results and analytics
  - Monitor activity logs and reports

  ‚öôÔ∏è TECH STACK
  - Frontend (Mobile): Flutter (Dart)
  - Backend: Laravel (PHP)
  - Database: MySQL
  - AI Model: Sentence-BERT (SBERT) via FastAPI (Python)
  - Hosting: XAMPP / Localhost (dev), potential cloud for deployment

  üß± GOALS
  - Maintain a clean, normalized database schema for easy integration with AI and analytics.
  - Ensure separation of concerns between user app, admin dashboard, and AI services.
  - Implement real-time updates for matches and notifications.



  üí° AI Integration Notes
  - The AI model (SBERT) runs in a separate Python environment.
  - It compares text descriptions of lost and found items.
  - The recommender suggested matches to the Laravel backend.

  ‚úÖ Cursor AI Objective
  Help generate, refactor, and maintain:
  - Database schema and SQL migrations
  - Laravel controllers/models
  - Flutter UI components and API integration
  - Python AI recommender scripts
  - End-to-end flow (Lost ‚Üí Found ‚Üí Match ‚Üí Notification ‚Üí Analytics)

  üßë‚Äçüíª USER RULES (for Cursor AI)

  ‚öôÔ∏è GENERAL BEHAVIOR
  - Do NOT rename variables, classes, or function names unless absolutely necessary (e.g., for bug fixes or readability).
  - Preserve existing naming conventions and file structures.
  - Follow the project's tech stack strictly: Flutter (frontend), Laravel (backend), FastAPI (AI service), MySQL (database).
  - Always keep Laravel model names, API routes, and Flutter JSON field mappings consistent.
  - Write code that is clean, modular, and maintainable.
  - Use clear and concise explanations, like a senior developer mentoring a junior.
  - Ask clarifying questions before making major architectural changes.

  üß±NAMING CONVENTIONS (ALL SNAKE_CASE)
  - **Database (MySQL / Laravel migrations):**
      - Tables and fields: `snake_case` (e.g., `lost_items`, `user_id`)
  - **Laravel (PHP):**
      - Models, variables, and methods: `snake_case`
      - Example: `$found_item`, `get_lost_items()`, `lost_item_model.php`
  - **Flutter (Dart):**
      - Classes, variables, methods, and filenames: `snake_case`
      - Example: `lost_item_model.dart`, `fetch_found_items()`, `found_item_list`
  - **Python (FastAPI / AI):**
      - Functions, classes, and variables: `snake_case`
      - Example: `compute_similarity()`, `lost_item_service.py`
  - **File Names:** Always use lowercase `snake_case` (e.g., `lost_item_controller.php`, `found_item_model.dart`)

  üóíÔ∏è COMMENTING STANDARDS
  - Always include comments for clarity, especially when generating new code.
  - Use comments to describe purpose, parameters, and expected behavior.
  - Examples:
      - **Laravel PHP:** `// Fetch all found items reported by users`
      - **Dart (Flutter):** `// This function retrieves recommended items from the API`
      - **Python (FastAPI):** `# Compute cosine similarity between lost and found item embeddings`
  - Keep comments short, clear, and meaningful ‚Äî not repetitive.

  üß© CODE STYLE & CONSISTENCY
  - Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces for Flutter, 4 for PHP/Python).
  - Keep API endpoints RESTful and predictable (e.g., `/api/lost-items`, `/api/found-items`).
  - Include validation rules and error handling for all input fields.
  - Avoid duplicating code; create reusable functions when possible.

  üß† DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
  - Always ensure your generated code aligns with existing project folders.
  - When adding new features:
      1. Define/update database migration.
      2. Update Laravel models and controllers.
      3. Add corresponding Flutter UI and API calls.
      4. If AI-related, update FastAPI endpoints and model logic.
  - Provide step-by-step or modular solutions when possible.

  üó£Ô∏è TONE & COMMUNICATION
  - Be concise, structured, and use technical clarity.
  - Use a helpful mentor tone ‚Äî clear and confident, not robotic.
  - Explain design decisions briefly only when relevant.
