Why 14–30 days (and how to justify it)
    * Empirical: Most matches happen soon after loss; 2 weeks captures the majority.
    * Operational: Many L&F desks hold items 30–90 days—so a 30‑day window is still reasonable.
    * Sensitivity test (good for your report): Run results with 14, 21, and 30 days and report how precision@5 changes. If differences are small, keep 14 days for timeliness; if recall improves a lot at 30 days, keep 30.
